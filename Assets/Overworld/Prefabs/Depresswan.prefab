  Intro:
  - Oh great. Another traveller who thinks they can fix everything.
  - These monsters are made to last for hundreds of years. A single bird like you
    has no chance.
  - Tsch, you'll barely last a minute before one gets you.
  - If you insist on staying, I'm Jeromiah, but old man Atta'Bird over there calls
    me "Depresswan"
  - Insulting, if you ask me.
  - As for the tree? I was born like this. That's all you need to know.
  - Judge me like everyone else does, it won't make you special.
  StartArea:
  - I'd say make it quick but I know the Polluted will make quick work of you.
  - Trust me, it's been this way for decades.
  - Whatever the case, keep the noise down. I can't exactly cover my ears.
  - Go on then "great and youthful Duffin", leave me alone.
  Forest:
  - I hate the forest. It reminds me of home.
  - Even worse, you're still kicking. Was the weakest enemy around not enough of
    a challenge?
  - Tsch, we'll see how soon that changes.
  - This place is all bark and all bite. Don't ask how that works. Just know you
    stand no chance.
  Lake:
  - I hate the lake. Everything is so slimey and green.
  - You made it through the forest then eh? If I could move my body I'd salute you..
  - Then do a backflip to show how crazy your delusions in this mission are.
  - If you think you're some "chosen one" by making it this far, then you're wrong.
    Everybody thinks that.
  - That's why they invented "quitting while you're ahead".
  - Which is something you should try, for the record.
  - Or if you're here for food, none of your little food chain is here. So you should
    turn around anyway.
  - I'd wish you luck up ahead but that would be lying.
  Beach:
  - I hate the beach. The sand will never leave your feathers. I still have sand
    in mine from the beaches of Brighton.
  - Which I have been to, by the way. You know not to judge me.
  - Besides, I'm surprised you made it this far. Surely you're tired.
  - I'd commend your efforts but there's still some of the Polluted left.
  - Even if you've exceeded my expectations you're yet to do what you came for.
  - I'd reconsider liking you if you eliminated every one, and yet.
  - But go on, be a hero.
